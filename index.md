I am a **Research Adviser** at the **Bank of England**, with a PhD in Economics and Finance from Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona. My main research topics are macroeconomics, household finance, functioning of credit markets and financial regulation.

I co-organize the Workshop on Household Finance and Housing, held in-person in London in June every year. Slides and recorded videos from the past iterations of the workshop can be accessed here - [2025](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/events/2025/june/6th-workshop-on-household-finance-and-housing); [2023](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/events/2023/june/4-workshop-household-finance-and-housing); [2022](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/events/2022/june/household-finance-and-housing-workshop); [2021](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/events/2021/june/household-finance-and-housing-workshop); [2020](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/events/2020/june/virtual-workshop-on-household-finance-and-housing).

I use this website to disseminate my research. All opinions and observations here are my own and not meant to represent those of the Bank of England.
